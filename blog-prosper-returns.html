        About five years ago, I decided to allocate some capital into peer-to-peer lending through
        <strong>Prosper</strong>. At the time, the platform’s advertised interest rates looked very
        attractive—often in the 8–12% range depending on loan grades. It seemed like a promising
        way to diversify outside of stocks and real estate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, the reality turned out to be different. Defaults, late payments, servicing fees,
        and early repayments slowly chipped away at my returns. As you can see in the chart below,
        my rate of return started strong, peaked near double digits, but then gradually declined as
        loans aged and more defaults occurred.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, my <strong>all-time return settled around 3.8%</strong>—much lower than the
        advertised yields. This doesn’t mean Prosper is a bad platform, but it highlights the gap
        between headline rates and actual net returns once you factor in defaults, idle cash, and
        taxes.
      </p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The headline borrower rates are not what investors actually earn.</li>
        <li>Defaults and servicing fees have the biggest impact on reducing returns.</li>
        <li>Prepayments limit interest earned and create reinvestment risk.</li>
        <li>After taxes, the final return can be closer to a savings account than a stock market investment.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Overall, I view Prosper as a decent experiment, but not the wealth-building engine it once
        seemed. A steady <strong>3–4% return</strong> is respectable compared to a bank account,
        but it doesn’t justify the extra risk for me personally.
