      <h1>My 5-Year Experience with Prosper P2P Investing</h1>
      <p class="muted">Published: August 23, 2025 · Investing · P2P Lending · Personal Finance</p>

      <p>
        About five years ago, I allocated a small slice of my portfolio to peer-to-peer lending on <strong>Prosper</strong>.
        The headline borrower rates (often 8–12% depending on loan grade) looked attractive and felt like a nice diversifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reality set in as the notes aged: late payments, defaults, servicing/collection fees, and prepayments chipped away at the yield.
        Early principal payoffs created reinvestment gaps, and idle cash dragged returns between allocations.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Net-net, my <strong>all-time return settled around 3.8%</strong>—well below the advertised note rates once defaults,
        fees, cash drag, and taxes were factored in. That doesn’t make Prosper “bad,” but it highlights the gap between
        borrower APRs and investor returns.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Defaults and servicing fees are the biggest haircut to returns.</li>
        <li>Prepayments cap interest earned and force reinvestment at uncertain rates.</li>
        <li>Idle cash between allocations creates cash-drag.</li>
        <li>Tax treatment (ordinary income) further reduces the take-home yield.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For me, the experiment was useful but not a core holding. A steady <strong>3–4%</strong> net return didn’t justify the extra risk
        compared with other options in my portfolio.
      </p>
